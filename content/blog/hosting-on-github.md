## Previous Setup
I used the hosting I got with my domain name, I build the website locally and used SFTP to upload the files.

## Why I switched
I wanted to have a more automated process, I wanted to be able to write a post and have it online in a few minutes. Now I can just push the changes to the repository and it's online.

## How I did it
I used GitHub Pages to host the website, I used the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator to build the website. I followed the [official guide](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) to host the website on Github Pages. After a few minutes of setting up the repository and the workflow, I had the website online.

## Conclusion
:+1: it works.
