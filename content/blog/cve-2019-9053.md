title: Rewriting CVE-2019-9053

## What is CVE-2019-9053?
CVE-2019-9053 is an Unauthenticated Time-Based SQL Injection for CMS Made Simple. For more information, you can read [this post](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9053) from NIST. It exploits an SQL Injection vulnerability in the `m1_idlist` parameter in the `moduleinterface.php` file.

## Rewriting the PoC
The PoCs I found were all the same and outdated and pretty slow. This is how I made my own improved version. This is the [original PoC](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46635) I found. 

It reuses a lot of the same code which is not necessary. I rewrote it to be more efficient and faster. It was also written in Python 2, which is outdated and not supported anymore. I rewrote it in Python 3 with some better libraries. 

I saw the original used the [requests library](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html) I switched it for the [HTTPX library](https://www.python-httpx.org/). Instead of getting the start and end time for the request, I used the `timeout` parameter of the HTTPX client. It also used 4 different functions for the same thing, I combined them into one function. 

## Conclusion
I managed to rewrite the PoC to be more efficient and faster with 114 less lines of code and updated libraries.
