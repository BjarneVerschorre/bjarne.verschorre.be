## 👋 Hello World!
My name is Bjarne, a 19 year old programmer and cybersecurity enthusiast.

I've build this website to share my knowledge and projects with you and learn web development while doing so. This website is made with a minimalistic design, so it's easy to read and navigate.


## 📚 Things I'm Learning
### [Go(lang)](https://go.dev/)
I'm currently following [Learn Go with tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/) to learn test-driven development in Go. You can follow my progress on [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/BjarneVerschorre/Learn-Go-with-tests).

### [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/)
By forcing myself to use Tmux whenever I can, I'm learning how to use it effectively and efficiently.

### [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
I've replaced [nano](https://nano-editor.org/) with Neovim to try and use it to better my productivity when editing files through the CLI.

## 📖 Currently Reading
