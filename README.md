## 🧰 Tech used
- It is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator written in Go
- The CSS is a modified version of [new.css](https://newcss.net/), a classless CSS framework
- Website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), I made a post about it [here](https://bjarne.verschorre.be/blog/hosting-on-github/)
- Everything else is just vanilla HTML, CSS, JS and Markdown
